# Scanify-App

Scanify is a mobile application to enhance the shopping experience of a user in a store by reducing human interaction and making the shopping process faster and more accurate. Through this application, the customers would be able to scan information of an entire section in a shop, store, showroom, or mall. The information would consist of product details that would be useful for a user’s shopping process. For consumable goods, the information could be reviews, prices, flavours, sales/discounts (if any), etc. For clothing products, it could be reviews, colours and sizes available, prices, sales/discounts (if any), etc.


The salesperson may not be present at all times to answer our queries regarding products, and their suggestions and reviews might not be unbiased and accurate. This application provides its users with accurate reviews from the buyers instead of the sellers. 

This app also eliminates the need for physical interaction between the customer and sales executives, thereby making the shopping experience faster and smoother.


So there is no overhead cost to collect data specifically for the app. The cost for maintaining the database would simply be covered by redirecting the pay given to sales executives to the extra technical staff. This way the customer’s experience is enhanced and neither retailers nor shoppers bear any extra cost.



The goal is to design a mobile application for customers to shop in malls, medium to large sized shops and medium to large sized showrooms with a multitude of brands and products to choose from. This product aims to enhance the shopping experience of a user by reducing human interaction and making the shopping process faster and more accurate. 
Through this application, the customers would be able to scan information of an entire section in a shop, store, showroom, or mall.
